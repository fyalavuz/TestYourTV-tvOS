# TestYourTV - App Store Marketing Asset Plan

## 🎨 Asset Generation Strategy
I have generated 4 high-quality background mockups in the `nanobanana-output/` folder.
- **Style:** 2 Photorealistic Living Room scenes & 2 Abstract Tech scenes.
- **Usage:** These images feature a **Green Screen** on the TV. 
    1. Open the mockup in an image editor (Photoshop, Canva, etc.).
    2. Use the "Magic Wand" or "Color Range" tool to select and delete the Green area.
    3. Place your App Screenshot layer *behind* the mockup frame.
